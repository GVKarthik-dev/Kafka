# Kafka Projects with Python

This repository contains multiple projects demonstrating how to integrate **Kafka** with **Python** backends for real-time data processing and communication. Each project showcases a unique use case, ranging from 🍔 food ordering systems to 💬 real-time messaging applications, all implemented with **FastAPI** and Kafka as the message broker. 🚀💻

## Projects

### Project 1: Food Ordering System using FastAPI and Kafka

**Directory:** [Project_1](./Project_1)

**Description:**  
A food ordering system that utilizes FastAPI for creating RESTful APIs and Kafka for handling message-driven interactions between services. This project includes functionalities for generating orders, processing transactions, analyzing revenue, and sending email notifications. 📧💵  
*Warning: May cause excessive hunger! 🍕🍔🥗*

### Project Structure
(You may want to add details about the project structure here. Don't worry, I won't judge if it’s just pizza slices! 🍕)

### Project 2: Messaging Application with FastAPI and Kafka

**Directory:** [Project_2](./Project_2)

**Description:**  
A simple messaging application built with **FastAPI** and **Kafka** for real-time message delivery. This application allows users to send and receive messages securely. 🔒✉️  
*Perfect for sending secrets like "I love pineapple on pizza" 🍍🍕 (don’t tell anyone)!*

## Features
- User authentication with JWT 🔑 (because sharing is caring, but not with your passwords!)
- Send and receive messages 📤📥 (like sending a virtual high-five! 🙌)
- Real-time messaging via WebSockets 🌐 (faster than your cat can knock over a glass!)
- Message storage in SQLite 🗄️ (it’s like a treasure chest for your chats! 🏴‍☠️)

Let the fun begin! 🎉
